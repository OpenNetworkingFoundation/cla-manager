/* Notes:

Today, only the signer of an agreement or addendum can read the document.

1. In the future, we may allow office admins to amend agreements by adding addendums
on behalf of a signer.

If this happens, we will need to update the canAmendAgreements to check to see if
the signer is authorized in the parent CLA as an admin.

TODO: get() doesn't appear to work in a function. If that changes in the future,
we might reconsider refactoring.

2. We may also allow users that are named in corporate agreements
to read, but not amend, the CLA that they are named on.

If this happens, we will need up update the read functions above.
