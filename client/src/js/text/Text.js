`Below is a sample email you should send to the person at your company who is authorized to sign ONF Institutional CLA.
If you don't know who that person is, you can start with your manager or director or company lawyer.

Dear <manager, CTO, lawyer, or similar>,

I would like to contribute to one of the Open Networking Foundation's (ONF) open source projects. This requires a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) to be signed between ONF and our company. Please find more information from the ONF CLA Information(https://wiki.opennetworking.org/display/COM/ONF+CLA+Information) page.

If we don't have an Institutional CLA signed with ONF, could you please sign one? It is a click-through agreement and only takes a few minutes. Then, can you please add my email address and GitHub ID(s) as listed below to our CLA?

Please visit ONF CLA Manager(https://cla.opennetworking.org/) to sign the CLA.

My email to be added to the CLA: ___

My GitHub ID(s) to be added to the CLA: ___

Thank you for your support!`
