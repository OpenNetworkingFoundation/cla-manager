`Dear <manager, CTO, lawyer, or similar>,

I would like to contribute to one of the Open Networking Foundation's (ONF) open source projects. This requires a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) to be signed between ONF and our company. Please find more information from the ONF CLA Information page:
https://wiki.opennetworking.org/x/BgCUI

If we don't have an Institutional CLA signed with ONF, could you please sign one? It is a click-through agreement and only takes a few minutes. Then, can you please add my email address and GitHub username(s) as listed below to our CLA?

Please visit ONF CLA Manager to sign the CLA:

My GitHub username(s) to be added to the CLA: ___

Thank you for your support!`
