## Individual Contributor License Agreement (“Agreement”)

Thank you for your interest in Open Networking Foundation (“ONF”). In order to
clarify the intellectual property licensed granted with Contributions from any person or entity,
each Contributor must agree to the terms of a Contributor License Agreement (“CLA”). This
license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of ONF and its users; it
does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.
You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future
Contributions submitted to ONF. Except for the license granted herein to ONF and recipients of
the Work (as defined below) distributed by ONF, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and
to Your Contributions.

1. Definitions.
“You” (or “Your”) shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the
copyright owner that is making this Agreement with ONF. For legal entities, the entity making a
Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control
with that entity are considered to be a single “Contributor.” For the purposes of this definition,
“control” means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
“Contribution” shall mean the code, documentation, use cases, or other works of
authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that are intentionally
submitted by You to ONF for inclusion in, or documentation of, any open source software
projects established, owned, or managed by ONF (the “Work”). For the purposes of this
definition, “submitted” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to
ONF or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing
lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf
of, ONF for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication
that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as “Not a Contribution.”

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, You hereby grant to ONF and to recipients of software distributed by ONF a
perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and
distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.    

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You
hereby grant to ONF and to recipients of software distributed by ONF a perpetual, worldwide,
non- exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily
infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the
Work to which such Contribution(s) were submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation
against You or any other entity (including a cross- claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
that Your Contribution, or the Work to which You have contributed, constitutes direct or
contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this
Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Right to Grant Licenses. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the
above licenses. If your employer(s) has (have) rights to intellectual property that you create that
includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make
Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your
Contributions to ONF, or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with ONF.

5. Original Creation. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original
creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). You represent that Your Contribution
submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including,
but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which
are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

6. Support; Warranty Disclaimer. You are not expected to provide support for Your
Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for
free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You
provide Your Contributions on an “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON- INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7. Contributions That Are Not Your Original Creation. Should You wish to submit
work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to ONF separately from any
Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction
(including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you
are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as “Submitted on behalf of a third-
party: &#91;named here&#93;”.

8. Required Notifications. You agree to notify ONF of any facts or circumstances
of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.

## Institutional Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement")


Thank you for your interest in the Open Networking Foundation (“ONF”).  In order to clarify the intellectual property 
license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, ONF must have a Contributor License Agreement (“CLA”) on 
file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your
protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of ONF and its users; it does not change your rights to use your 
own Contributions for any other purpose.

This version of the Agreement allows an entity (the "Institution") to submit Contributions to ONF, to authorize 
Contributions submitted by its designated employees to ONF, and to grant copyright and patent licenses thereto.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your Contributions submitted to ONF. Except for the 
license granted herein to ONF and recipients of software distributed by ONF, You reserve all right, title, and interest 
in and to Your Contributions.

1. Definitions.
"You" (or "Your") shall mean the Institution that is making this Agreement with ONF, which must be the copyright owner
of the Contribution(s) or be authorized by the copyright owner to make the Contribution(s) under this Agreement.  
The Institution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with the Institution
are considered to be a single “Contributor.”  For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct
or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership 
of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
"Contribution" shall mean the code, documentation, use cases, or other works of authorship, including any modifications 
or additions to an existing work, that are intentionally submitted by You to ONF for inclusion in, or documentation of,
any of the open source software projects established, owned, or managed by ONF (the "Work"). For the purposes of this
definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to ONF or its 
representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, ONF for the purpose of discussing and improving the 
Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as 
"Not a Contribution."

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to ONF and to 
recipients of software distributed by ONF a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and 
distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to ONF and to 
recipients of software distributed by ONF a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily
infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
Contribution(s) were submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or the Work to which You have contributed,
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this
Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Right to Grant Licenses. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. You represent 
further that each employee or other representative of the Institution designated on Schedule A attached hereto (as it
may be modified from time to time) is authorized to submit Contributions on behalf of the Institution.  You further
represent that the Primary Contact and Alternate Contact (if any) designated above, or such successor Primary Contact
or Alternate Contact that You designate via written notice to ONF, each have the power and authority to modify Schedule
A by providing written notice of such modification to ONF.  Notice of any change to Your Primary Contact, Alternate
Contact, or Schedule A may be provided via e-mail message by Your then-current Primary Contact or Alternate Contact,
and does not need to be in the form of a signed amendment to this Agreement to be binding upon the parties.

5. Original Creation.  You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section 7 for
submissions on behalf of others).

6. Support; Warranty Disclaimer.  You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent
You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable
law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7. Contributions That Are Not Your Original Creation.  Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original
creation, You may submit it to ONF separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and
of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements)
of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party:
&#91;named here&#93;".

8. Required Notifications.  It is Your responsibility to notify ONF when any change is required to the list of
designated employees authorized to submit Contributions on behalf of the Institution, or to the Institution's Primary
Contact or Alternate Contact.

9. This Agreement Supersedes Prior Agreements.  If You have previously entered into an Institutional Contributor License
 Agreement with ONF related to any one or more open source software projects established, owned, or managed by ONF, this
 Agreement shall supersede and replace all such prior agreements.
